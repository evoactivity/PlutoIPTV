# PlutoIPTV for TVHeadend in Python

Grab EPG &amp; M3U from Pluto.tv

Based on the work of https://github.com/TylerB260/PlutoXML and https://github.com/evoactivity/PlutoIPTV

### Usage

```bash
$ pluto.py $ARGS
```
With no arguments, the following files will be created in the same directory as the script:

- plutotvepg.xml (EPG)
- plutotv.m3u8 (M3U8 Playlist)
- plutocache.json (raw JSON cache file)
- plutotv.log (Log file)

                        Latitude in decimal format
</pre>
#### --debugmode (optional)

Debug mode will ignore all directory options and create the subdirectory ./pluto_debug/ next to the script. The M3U and XML files will not be generated, but instead added straight into the log. The log and cache files will be saved into ./pluto_debug/.

#### --time (optional)

As it is now, Pluto only delivers a maximum of about 9-10 hours of EPG. The script defaults to 8. If you need more you can push it, but this setting was added more to limit EPG than to add to it.

#### --longitude, --latitude (optional)

Pluto.tv stream urls are autopopulated with your geolocation as decimal longitude and latitude. If the values are changed to zero it doesn't seem to make a difference, but I added the option to change them in case advertisements are targeted by location, or the values are one day used for the saddest, easy to bypass geoblocking ever. Format is NN.NNNN/-NN.NNNN (to four decimal points).

#### --dir, --cache, --epg, --log (optional)

Pretty self-explanatory â€” Where you want the individual files to go. The default directory is next to the script. Filenames themselves are static and can't be changed. --dir is M3U save location.

#### --picondir (optional)

A location to store channel logos as "picons". Logo images will be pulled from the pluto.tv site, expanded into a square picon (no cropping takes place, only expansion of the canvas), and saved with a channel-identifiable filename in the directory submitted. If not used with --bgcolour1, --colourful or --bright, the image background remains transparent.

#### --bgcolour1 (optional)

A hexidecimal RGB value (#1F1F1F) to be used as background colour in picons. If used with --bgcolour2, --colourful or --bright, becomes the first colour of a gradient, otherwise used to as a solid background colour. 

#### --bgcolour2 (optional)

A hexidecimal RGB value (#1F1F1F) to be used as the secondary colour in background gradients. Only used in conjunction with. --bgcolour1.

#### --angle (optional)

If used with --colourful, --bright or combined --bgcolour1 and bgcolour2, defines the angle used for the background gradient. Defaults to "random"[^1].

#### --colourful (optional)

A bit misleading a name, but creates a muted gradient background for the picons. Colours are by default "random"[^1]. The angle of the gradient can be set using --angle, but can also defaults to "random"<sup>*</sup>.

#### --bright (optional)

Creates an intensely colourful background gradient for the picons. Same idea as --colourful, but looks best with --monopicon. Also defaults colour choice to "random"[^1].

#### --monopicon (optional)

Download white logo of default colour logo. Can be used with all other background options

#### --overwritepicons (optional)

This option forces an overwrite of those picon files. By default, if the picondir option is selected, the script will only download those icons it cannot find in the given directory. This dramatically speeds up the script and saves needless downloads. Can be useful if icons/channels change or as an once-a-week option. 

[^1]: "Random" is not truly random, but a value created using a portion of the UID of the channel. As such, it may seem random across different channel picons, but that value remains constant for a given channel.*
